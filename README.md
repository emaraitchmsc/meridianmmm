# üß† Marketing Mix Modeling with Google Meridian

This project uses **Google Meridian** to run a probabilistic Marketing Mix Model (MMM), optimizing marketing spend across channels using Bayesian inference. The analysis uncovers channel contributions, response curves, and budget reallocation strategies.

## üß© Project Overview

- **Objective**: Quantify the incremental impact of marketing channels and simulate return curves for budget optimization.
- **Tool**: [Google Meridian](https://github.com/google/meridian) ‚Äì a Bayesian modeling library for MMM.
- **Data**: Daily marketing performance data with KPIs, spend, impressions, and channel-specific metrics.
- **Scope**: Focused on UK + US campaigns with population-aware modeling.

## üìä Key Results

### Channel Contribution
- **Baseline** accounts for **47.3%** of performance (452k KPI units)
- Top Paid Channels:
  - `GOOGLE_DISPLAY`: **24.0%** (229k)
  - `GOOGLE_PAID_SEARCH`: **11.2%** (107k)
  - `META_OTHER`: **6.3%** (61k)

### Response Curves
- Google Display shows the steepest and most scalable growth potential.
- Google Paid Search is nearing saturation.
- Meta channels show early diminishing returns.

## üß™ Modeling Pipeline

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Merges media, spend, population, and controls
   - Currency normalization and NaN handling

2. **Model Building**
   - Defined with KPIs, media, revenue-per-KPI, controls, and population
   - Channels mapped using `CoordToColumns`

3. **Sampling**
   - Prior sampling for parameter initialization
   - Posterior MCMC sampling for inference

4. **Visualization**
   - Contribution waterfall
   - Response curves and saturation detection
   - Budget optimization (optional in extension)
